      I would not describe myself as someone who likes to leave their comfort zone. But I am starkly competitive and frustrated when I don't understand how to do or say something. This frustration has contributed greatly to my professional philosophy of purposely passing off the things I do well, and instead investing in the things I do poorly. It is a long journey, far from over, and this recollection of the journey so far isn't a novel nor a manifesto... it's just putting words down on a page for you to read (and hopefully enjoy).
